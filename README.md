# WeatherApp
This is a side project which uses the OpenWeatherMap and Twitter API to give info on a current location's weather with built in predictive search functionality.

## Installation

I used [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to run my project.

After downloading VS code, download live server as an extension. To access extensions in VS Code, click on the extension tab ```Windows: CTRL + Shift + X ``` ```Mac: Shift + âŒ˜ + X``` when in VS Code.

Once Live Server is downloaded, ```right click``` on ```"index.html"``` then click ```"Open With Live Server"```.

## Usage

Type in a US city name and information on the current weather will be displayed.
